let number=10
//bigint for greater range

let string = 'ansh'
let boolean=true

// undefined simply means not defined 

// null -> standalone value more like nothing is there

// symbol -> unique

// let object  to be studied later


let array = [1,'ansh','boom',3] //allows different data types and is dynamic
